# robotic-pen
pen which can draw straight lines circles angles and some of the basic geometrical structure 
We will be using (1)arduino uno (2)esp 8266 and some of the important actuators and sensors(servo motor, dc motor, camera) which would help us in writing alphabets and draw some basic geometrical structures such as circles straight lines angles perpendicular line bisectors. We can command this instrument using our mobile phone or via laptop and also we can give it a handwritten question or a tell it what to write which would be recognized by the camera and machine learning algorithms. So basically the given problem will be divided into almost 60 cases in which 26 are Capatial letters, 26 are small letters, 1 is for the space, 1 is for given radius, 1 is for straight line segment of a given length, 1 is for the angle, 1 is for the sector, 1 is for the square of given side length, 1 is for the triangle with all the three sides given, 1 is for the rectangle. We can add much more cases to it  as requiered. We will be training our machine learning algorithm using different handwritten letters. Using esp 8266 and blynk app we will also connect our phone to our device and command it through phone.
